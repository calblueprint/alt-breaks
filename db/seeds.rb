From the squirrels that run about the trees and telephone wires of our own Berkeley campus to the untamed beasts of
 the unfamiliar wilderness we're surrounded by creatures big and small. And there's something about us and these creatures
 -- a fascination, a passion, a connection, an indescribably intense yearning to understand -- and again and again, we give
 into our curiosities and instincts. Yet in our anthropocentric society, we often overlook pressing animal welfare issues
 and repeatedly turn a blind eye to even the most outrageous of unmasked truths. We live in a world of sensitive ecology,
 but all too often fail to consider the repercussions of our actions on our Earth's co-inhabitants in the hunt for our own
 convenience and benefit. In our DeCal, we'll familiarize ourselves with some of the nation's most pressing animal welfare
 issues, including past and current animal welfare legislation, lab testing, pet overpopulation, shelter policy, wildlife
 preservation, and domestic animal abuse, through classroom debate and discussion, guest lectures, and field trips to local
 facilities, such as animal shelters and wildlife hospitals. Having acquainted ourselves with the local air, we'll make our
 way up to southern Oregon where participants will have the opportunity to engage with, learn from, and contribute to the
 efforts of our community partners at animal shelters, preserves, and sanctuaries. As in the words of our past leaders, we
 hope that our trip participants will conclude their semester knowing that they can be an impenetrable voice for those who
 have no words, after having experienced firsthand the silent, living testaments to stories of mistreatment, neglect, but most
 strikingly and lastingly, of strength and resilience."

waaa_desc = "In the context of the ongoing national debate over immigration reform and Arizona's SB1070 legislation, we will examine the Grand Canyon State as an epicenter of cross-cultural dynamism and tension. We will explore the causes and impact of Latin American immigration through a discussion of politics, economics, and culture. We will also explore encompassing contemporary concerns that include the following but are not limited to: patterns of globalization, NAFTA, education, the drug war, nativism, ethnic politics, migrant labor, the social consequences associated with SB1070 and its effect on immigrants and communities of color as well as criminalization and imprisonment of these communities, and learn about the movements that support and resist the SB1070 bill to understand both sides of the story. In an effort to encounter a wide array of perspectives, past trips have spoken with politicians, activists, community organizers, border patrol officers, migrant workers, and civilians. We hope to immerse ourselves in the complex intersections between Arizona's communities, all cohabiting in a tumultuous environment which forces the signs of protesters to remind the world 'We Have Rights,' 'Do I Look Illegal?' and 'We Are Human.' In addition, we aim to increase political education, understand how differences and intersectionalities continue to draw attacks against communities and spark more conversation with folks on campus and surrounding communities about these issues. We are offering a space for people of all interests, backgrounds, and perspectives to learn how we all have a role in this complex and fascinating immigration debate. *DREAMers & AB540 students are welcomed to apply!"

votu_desc = "The United States was once deemed the Land of Plenty, but since the beginning of this country's history Native Americans have been forced to defend their rights. Present-day statistics and subsequent inaction by lawmakers reveal a harsh reality: 1 in every 4 Native Americans live in poverty, 1/3 lack basic access to health care, and Natives face the highest high school drop-out and male suicide rate among all ethnic groups. Our participants will begin to examine the story and voices behind these numbers and discuss how political, geographical, and economical factors have led to unequal outcomes in Native communities. We will examine the perpetuation of inequalities through U.S. policies towards the Native American population, resistance movements formed in response to such oppression, and also reformulate current preconceptions about Native Americans to increase awareness of their culture. Participants will build relationships with community partners such as tribal, educational, and health leaders, who live to make a difference on the Campo reservation. We hope to offer participants the opportunity to learn about a community different than their own, engage in critical dialogue and really just learn about one's own privilege and how we can extend that to help advocate and be allies for other communities."

hocc_desc = "Between the glam of Los Angeles and the technological innovation of San Francisco lies a vast and ignored expanse of our state that is vital to our nation's economy and sustenance through agriculture. But behind the neat rows of produce harvested is an agricultural business that relies on cheap labor for its enormous profits by abusing the vulnerability of workers in the impoverished communities of our states' Central Valley. We will explore the roles of institutionalized racism and classism used to perpetuate the idea of farmworkers as second status citizens. As Californian citizens, we have the responsibility to educate ourselves on the social justice issues surrounding the Central Valley. We will shed light on the living and working conditions of the 1.6 million farmworkers who bring us the convenience and affordability of produce in the supermarkets, as well as the systematic criminalization of citizens in these marginalized communities. In this Decal we will learn about 'la causa' for farmworkers' rights and mass incarceration through readings, guest lecturers, documentaries, and most importantly, discussion and reflection amongst ourselves. We will travel to the Central Valley, the birthplace of the United Farmworker's Association and the most recent birthplace of an ever-expanding prison system. Therefore, the economically driven and politically charged system of mass incarceration and its impact on these rural communities is another issue we will explore. During our weeklong trip to the Central Valley we will volunteer alongside community organizers and have the opportunity to witness the living and working conditions of farmworkers, as well as learn more about the structural economics and politics behind our nations' prison system. We will also draw connections between these seemingly unrelated issues to gain a deeper understanding of how our society perpetuates oppression of marginalized groups."

ej_desc = "In a country with a turbulent history of civil rights movements, environmental justice is one such movement that seeks to establish healthy living conditions in communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental risks and hazards. These communities often consist of people of color and low-income populations, demonstrating the need to address how institutional factors play a role in distribution of resources and concentrated pollution. In our DeCal, we will look at how environmental discrimination manifests itself locally, nationally, and internationally through examining sites such as the Toxic Triangle in the Bay Area, the environmental effects of maquiladoras in Mexico, and the pervasive health problems created by both natural and man-made disasters, such as the BP oil spill. Additionally, we will seek to develop tools that promote individual and community empowerment. During our week-long trip, our group will travel around the Bay Area, where we will partner with organizations that develop youth leadership in environmental justice and foster coalition-building among different communities to promote environmental justice."

fft_desc = "FACT!!!: Americans spend 9.4% of their disposable income on food. That is less than any other country in the world.

CONSEQUENCES!!!: Obesity, type II diabetes, commodification of food, factory farming, corn syrup, processing, packaging, pollution, pesticides, fertilizers, and tasteless food-like products. FACT!!!: In our decal we will challenge some pressing issues within the food system and learn about the way our food choices affect the planet. We will forage through readings, discussions and guest speaker lectures, so that participants will be able to form their own 'ethics of eating'. By understanding some of the unsavory politics and economics which drive production, we can begin to question the choices we make. FACT!!!: Our week long trip through the greater bay area will offer a taste of what it's like to get down and dirty with real organic farmers. We will witness how sustainable agriculture as a way of life can change the food system from the roots up. Cheers! FACT: Carrots used to be purple before the 17th century."

gms_desc = "Did you know that there are 24 empty homes for every homeless person in the United States according to the recent census? Clearly, this nation has the capacity to provide for each of its citizens, yet we walk onto the streets and see people struggling to get by. And there's a lot more we don't see. Poverty comes in many forms, not just the case of living on the streets. In our DeCal, we will study and debate complex facets of homelessness and poverty, including youth displacement, food security, government policy and homelessness in the media. Participants will gain a better understanding of the root causes of poverty and the factors impacting homeless populations. Our trip will take us to Sacramento and San Francisco, where we will volunteer with diverse organizations and learn about the resources they provide. By engaging deeply with the issue of homelessness, participants will be pushed to challenge their preconceptions, examine their privilege, and appreciate the shared human experiences that connect all people- regardless of income."

nola_desc = "Don't panic. If you don't know what social justice means, that's okay. Are you curious about society and its issues, but never volunteered in your life? That's okay too. Social Justice looks at all aspects of society and tries to unearth why some inequalities exist. For example, in 2009 non-Hispanic blacks accounted for 39.4% of the total prison population, yet only comprised of 13.6% of US Population. Where does this discrepancy come from? Alternative Breaks explores this question and more throughout the spring semester. Alternative Breaks is very different from other volunteer organizations; we use a critical service learning approach where we question not only societal issues, but ourselves and the very nature of volunteer work. The best part of this approach is that every opinion is welcome. So if you are interested in Alt. Breaks but think you will feel out of place, then you should apply. We want people with opposing opinions, we want skeptics, critics, and idealists. We want business majors, science majors, engineers, artists, and psychologists! We need botanists, etymologists, and political scientists.
In the New Orleans trip, we explore inequality, injustice, and culture in the 'prison capital of the world'. We will look at the lack of progress since Hurricane Katrina, and see first-hand how relief resources were allocated between the rich and poor. We will work side-by-side with community members who have dedicated their lives to justice and stability. We will also explore one of the most culturally rich communities and be embraced by one of the most welcoming cities in the United States. In our DeCal, we will discuss our perceptions, thoughts, and ideas of social justice. We will challenge our own perceptions and those of our peers through guest speakers, films, discussions, reflection, and more. The Alternative Breaks program will be challenging your perceptions and thoughts, and we hope you embrace the challenge!"

sdt_desc = "In the United States discourse about immigration has always focused on heterosexual men. This Spring we will be deconstructing the patriarchal and racist perception of immigration that the media and our government have established over the past years. We will focus on giving voices to those who have been erased from history and have been pushed into the shadows. Through the exploration of the historical, political and social implications, we will expand to include the his/herstory of undocumented wo/men and queer communities (with a focus on women and queer communities). We will approach these topics through an intersectional lens so that we can try to be as inclusive and truthful to these people's stories as possible. We will question the rhetoric that has been used, such as 'illegal,' 'alien,' 'criminal,' and 'non-citizen,' and how these terms have become synonymous with immigration and have led to the creation of many underlying truths with fear. *DREAMers & AB540 students are welcomed to apply!"

phhp_desc = "Many people don't realize how dangerous life can be without health care. For most of us, we can take a trip to the doctor whenever we feel a bit down. However, for those without primary health care insurance, getting sick is a catastrophe, as the cost of care is enormous. So, people often end up postponing getting care if the condition is not immediately debilitating, which results in many more long-term problems. Another complication is that the ones without health care are often those in high stress and dangerous communities with poor nutrition and education, making them the most at risk for health problems. Through this trip we will explore inequalities in the US health care system, examine some consequences of this system, and analyze issues preventing universal health care. Participants will take a trip to LA during Spring Break and see the care given in LA clinics, homeless shelters, and hospitals. Participants will leave this experience armed with the knowledge, and hopefully the confidence, to affect change."
